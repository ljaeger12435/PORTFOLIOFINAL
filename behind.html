    <p> I was born 1998 in the south of Germany and currently I am a bachelor student of architecture at the Berliner Hochschule fuer Technik.</p>
        <p>After finishing middle school, I started an apprenticeship as a taylor in Irsee, sewing traditional dresses with a focus on handcrafting techniques.</p>
            <p>As soon as I finished my apprenticeship, I entered the fashion industry. Working in the fashion industry gave me insights into the immense inequalities in wealth distribution and how it is always the wealthy who benefit from precarious labor, growing richer at the expense of others.</p>
                <p>Seeing those inequalities, I developed the desire to contribute to society. So after working in the industry for two years full-time, I decided to pursue my Abitur (high school diploma) to be able to study at university. Seeing Architecture as the perfect intersection of art, culture, politics and technology, I chose it as my field of study, recognizing that my knowledge of fabrics and materials could be a valuable asset in architectural design.</p>
                    
                <p class="underline">This portfolio was created as a university project with the support of F. Ecem Ergin, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Architecture at Mimar Sinan Üniversitesi in Istanbul.</p>
